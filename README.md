# Loan Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a raw loan dataset. The main tasks performed on the dataset include examination, cleaning, preprocessing, conversion to EUR, and saving the cleaned dataset. Another dataset was used to create new columns in EUR, and a PDF file was utilized to group states into regions.

**Dataset**

The [dataset](https://github.com/Krisztana/Loan-Data/blob/main/loan-data.csv) consists of raw loan data, which requires examination and cleaning to ensure data quality. The initial dataset may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of raw loan data, which requires examination and cleaning to ensure data quality. The initial dataset may contain missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.

**Tasks**

The following tasks were performed on the dataset:

* Examination: Thoroughly examined the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and any potential issues.

* Cleaning: Employed data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers within the dataset.

* Preprocessing: Conducted preprocessing steps such as feature engineering, data transformation, and scaling to prepare the dataset for analysis.

* Conversion to EUR: Utilized another dataset to convert the loan amounts into Euros, providing additional information for analysis.

* Saving the Clean Dataset: Saved the cleaned and preprocessed dataset in a suitable format for further analysis and future reference.


**Additional Data and Resources**

* [EUR Conversion Dataset](https://github.com/Krisztana/Loan-Data/blob/main/EUR-USD.csv): Another dataset was used to create new columns in Euros, enriching the loan dataset with additional currency information.

* [Region Grouping](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf): A PDF file was utilized to group the states within the dataset into specific regions, providing geographical context for analysis.

**Conclusion**

This project aims to provide a cleaned and preprocessed loan dataset with additional information in Euros. Following the provided steps and exploring the Jupyter Notebook allows users to gain valuable insights from the dataset and utilize the cleaned data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
