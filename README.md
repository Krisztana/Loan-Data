# Loan-Data


It is a [raw loan dataset](https://github.com/Krisztana/Loan-Data/blob/main/loan-data.csv)

The tasks are: 
* examine the dataset
* clean it
* preprocess it
* provide information in EUR too
* save the new clean dataset

During the process, I also used another [data set](https://github.com/Krisztana/Loan-Data/blob/main/EUR-USD.csv) for creating the new columns in EUR.

And I used this [pdf file](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf) to group the states into regions.
